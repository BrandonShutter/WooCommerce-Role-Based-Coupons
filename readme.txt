Exclude Wordpress User Roles from using certain WooCommerce Coupons.

== Description ==

Adds a settings field on the Coupon edit screen that allows the administrator to exclude certain Wordpress user roles from using the Coupon. You can use this to offer coupons to a subset of your customers.

== Installation ==

0. Make sure WooCommerce is installed and running the latest version available.
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add a new coupon or edit an existing coupon. You'll notice a new settings field labeled "Excluded Roles." Choose the roles you'd like to exclude, and choose save. Those user roles will receive an "invalid coupon code" when entering the code on the WooCommerce site.
